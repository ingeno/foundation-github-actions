# This does a few things:
# - force pushes to main are forbidden (PRs are mandatory to push to main)
# - at least two code review approvals
# - if any file modified has an entry in CODEOWNERS, one code owner must approve
# - branch must be up-to-date to merge
# - disables status checks to merge PRs as there are no workflows running in this repo
# - commits must be signed
# - repository admins cannot bypass these rules
